# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Strategy & Plan of Action – CSIA 485 Capstone

This repository contains my final project for **CSIA 485: Cybersecurity Management and Policy Capstone** at the University of Maryland Global Campus. The project presents a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and implementation plan developed for the fictional acquisition of Island Banking Services by Padgett-Beale, Inc.

## 📘 Project Context

Padgett-Beale acquired the digital assets of a bankrupt foreign financial firm, Island Banking Services, which had no formal cybersecurity program and a history of criminal misconduct. As part of the M&A team, I was tasked with designing a full-scope cybersecurity program for the new subsidiary, **PBI Financial Services (PBI-FS)**.

## 🔍 Deliverables

- [Cyber Security Plan of Action.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21533071/Cyber.Security.Plan.of.Action.pdf)
Full report with:
  - **Gap Analysis** of inherited cybersecurity weaknesses
  - **Legal and Regulatory Requirements Analysis** (GLBA, SOX, BSA, etc.)
  - **Risk Register** with 10+ mapped risks using NIST CSF and SP 800-53
  - **Cybersecurity Strategy** featuring 5 core initiatives
  - **12-Month Implementation Timeline** with phases, tools, and resource estimates
  - **Executive Recommendation Memo**

## 🧠 Core Strategy Areas

1. **Establish Cybersecurity Governance**  
   Formalize leadership, roles, policies, and compliance monitoring.

2. **Implement Security Awareness Training**  
   Mandatory org-wide and role-specific training with phishing simulations.

3. **Deploy Identity and Access Management (IAM)**  
   RBAC, MFA, and automated user provisioning with tools like Okta.

4. **Launch Security Monitoring & Incident Response**  
   Deploy SIEM (e.g., Splunk), IDS/IPS, and SOC operations.

5. **Modernize Infrastructure & Secure Network Architecture**  
   Patch legacy systems, encrypt sensitive data, and implement segmented networks.


## 🗂️ Supporting Frameworks & Standards

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) v1.1**
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5**
- **People, Process, Technology (PPT) Model**
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad)**
- **U.S. Regulations**: GLBA, SOX, BSA, SEC, IRS
